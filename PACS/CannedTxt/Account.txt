Hi,

Your  PACS account has been set-up.

Username: 
Password: pacs2024

Please note the username and password are both in lower case.

You must first access PACS directly before attempting to access diagnostic images via third party applications (e.g. Trakcare).  You will then be prompted to change your password to a new password.  This must be one that has not been used before and must contain at least one number and one capital letter.
 
Keep your login details safe as they allow access to your personal details.
 
Do not use this system until you have received formal training as all actions are audited.  Link available here: http://firstport2/staff-support/radiology/General%20Info/Forms/DispForm.aspx?ID=17

Thanks.
